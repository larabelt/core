## Editing Data

Data Editors are generally made up of the same elements to allow consistent behavior throughout the system. Within the right pane of page you have the following:

**Current Area Indicator​​** ex. Place Editor

**Attribute Tabs​​** This navigation allows you to manage additional attributes associated with specific data—it will change depending on the type of data being managed. A green bar indicates the current tab.

**Data Area​​** fields to which data can be entered.

**Save Button​​** commits the data to the database and is made available immediately. ​(Note: Upon
initial save, additional attribute tabs will be made available.)
